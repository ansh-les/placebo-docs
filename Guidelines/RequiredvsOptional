> Should the form fields show the required* or (optional) label?

Required* labels let users know which fields are mandatory to fill before submitting a form.

However, adding the required label to many fields makes the UI more cluttered.

On the other hand, the (optional) label takes the opposite approach and only highlights the fields that are not mandatory.

While this removes visual noise, Nielsen Norman recommends against it. However, telling the users they have a choice also aligns with Nielsen Norman usability principles about user control and freedom.

## Rule #1

When all the fields are required — don't use the * (asterisk), but add a description saying "All fields are required.”

## Rule #2

When the number of required fields is over 50% — only highlight the optional ones.

## Rule #3

When the number of required fields is less than or equal to 50% — only highlight the required ones, but use the text label (keep the red colour for errors).
