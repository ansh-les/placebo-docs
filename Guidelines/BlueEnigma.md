> Why most buttons are blue nowadays? Why blue buttons get the highest clickthrough rate

## Habituation

Blue is the colour most users associate with click interactions. Since the beginning of the internet, blue has been the colour of links. Users are more likely to click when they see a blue button.

## Trust

Blue is also associated with dependability and trust. Users must trust that clicking a button will take them to the desired location. Blue buttons can benefit from colour psychology to increase clickthrough rates.

## Accessible

Blue buttons are the easiest for colourblind users. Red-green colourblindness is the most common type of colourblindness. Users with this colour blindness cannot correctly perceive green, red, orange, pink, or purple.

They do, however, perceive blue as a shade of blue.
